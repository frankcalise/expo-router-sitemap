# expo-router-sitemap

## Overview

Inspired by this [X post] by @kadikraman, I figured it would be useful to come up with a script that could check an Expo Router project.

## Development

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.27. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
